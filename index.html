  <h3 class="oya">Reading</h3>
  <p class="oya">My best skill is actually in reading almost anything i come across. I have read lots of books
    from Textbooks, Story books, Motivational books, Christian literatures and so on. This in turn
    has contributed immensely to my programming and design skill</p>
